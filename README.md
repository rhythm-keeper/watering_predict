Training an algorithm to understand the watering needs
of (non-potted) plants for local weather and soil conditions.

Algorithm will ultimately pull web weather data to make
daily predictions of soil moisture levels.

Algorithm requires measurement of soil moisture level
and simultaneous recording of factors including: 

outdoor temperature
humidity
date of measurement
date since last watering
hours of direct sun
hours of shade (can be derived from total daylight hours minus hours of direct sun)
soil type (clay, sand, etc.) 

Default algorithm is kNN.
